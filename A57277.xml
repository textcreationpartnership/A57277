            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Doctrine of <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantiation</hi> maintained by our Adver≈øaries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ≈øo gro≈øs, and highly repugnant to the fir≈øt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of rea≈øon, and univer≈øal ≈øen≈øe of mankind, that directly to defend it would be no le≈øs impo≈ø≈øible than un≈øucce≈øsful. Artifices therefore were nece≈ø≈øarily to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, which might palliate the deformity of ≈øo mon≈øtrous an Opinion; and divert inqui≈øitive per≈øons from a direct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of it, by amu≈øing them with confident a≈ø≈øertions and extraneous Controver≈øies. Among the≈øe, the difference of Opinion between the fir≈øt Reformers and pre≈øent Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath of late been propo≈øed and urged with the greate≈øt vehemency; as if the fir≈øt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers had believed ≈øomewhat equivalent to <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and our pre≈øent Divines, by a≈ø≈øerting no other than a figurative Pre≈øence of the material Body of Chri≈øt, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from the belief of their Forefathers.</p>
            <p>We might ju≈øtly admire the unrea≈øonable confidence of tho≈øe men, who are not a≈øhamed to propo≈øe ≈øo manife≈øt and gro≈øs a fal≈øhood, and e≈øteem it the highe≈øt folly; if we did not remember that it is taken up to defend a de≈øperate Cau≈øe, which admits no better Remedies. Can any Man in his right wits believe that ≈øo many hundred Martyrs ≈øhould ≈øuffer death, and ≈øpend their blood for ≈øo incon≈øiderable a nicety, as was the difference between them and their Per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors in the Doctrine of the <hi>Euchari≈øt,</hi> if the≈øe late Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenters may be believed? That both Parties ≈øhould di≈øpute
<pb facs="tcp:46245:4"/>
≈øo earne≈øtly and vehemently again≈øt each other, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all agree in the main? That the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Bi≈øhops ≈øhould treat the Reformers as Hereticks for denying <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;</hi> and the Reformers lay down their lives rather than acknowledge it; and yet neither the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> to have defined it to be true, nor the <hi>la≈øt</hi> believed it to be fal≈øe? Such crude Po≈øitions can find no entertainment, but in a mind already fitted to receive <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantiation</hi> it ≈øelf, that is, devoid of Sen≈øe and Rea≈øon.</p>
            <p>If we enquire the Rea≈øons and Arguments, wherewith our Adver≈øaries maintain ≈øuch incredible and extravagant a≈ø≈øertions, we ≈øhall find them to be no other than the≈øe, That the fir≈øt Reformers taught and a≈ø≈øerted a <hi>Real Pre≈øence</hi> of the Body and Blood of Chri≈øt in the Sacrament; That they maintained the Body and Blood to be verily and indeed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and received by the faithful Communicants; That they frequently affirmed the natural and ≈øub≈øtantial Body of Chri≈øt, that very Body which was taken by him of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> to be pre≈øent in the Sacrament. The≈øe very expre≈ø≈øions are at this day u≈øed by the Divines of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> whom yet our Adver≈øaries pretend to have departed from the belief of their Forefathers in this matter: So that if they prove the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Reformers to have believed a material pre≈øence of Chri≈øt's Body, they will prove our <hi>Pre≈øent Divines</hi> to believe the ≈øame. For the whole Controver≈øy will come to this i≈ø≈øue, Whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved any material Pre≈øence of Chri≈øt's Body, or any part of it, either by conver≈øion, ≈øub≈øtitution, or union? If they po≈øitively di≈øowned this, as mo≈øt certainly they did; then what≈øoever expre≈ø≈øions they might u≈øe, they could believe no other than a figurative Pre≈øence of Chri≈øt's Body properly ≈øo called; which our Adver≈øaries now traduce under the name of <hi>Zuingliani≈øm.</hi> And, indeed, if we give them leave to explain them≈øelves, they tell us, That in ≈øuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions
<pb facs="tcp:46245:4"/>
they u≈øe the terms of <hi>Real Pre≈øence, Nature</hi> and <hi>Sub≈øtance,</hi> not as Philo≈øophers, but as Divines; and that by denying the Euchari≈øt to be a figure only, or a naked figure, they mean no more, than that it is a true and real commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the virtues and benefits of his Body, not only a meer figurative commemoration of them, which is the true notion of <hi>Zuingliani≈øm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove this, and vindicate the honour of the fir≈øt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers and modern Divines of our Church, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate the intire conformity of the belief of both; it is thought convenient to cau≈øe ≈øome one Treati≈øe of the fir≈øt Reformers concerning this Subject to be Reprinted, that ≈øo every one might judge for him≈øelf, whether the preten≈øions of our Adver≈øaries be indeed true and ju≈øt; or rather the Pre≈øent is intirely conformable to the precedent Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To this end, among all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the fir≈øt Reformers, this Treati≈øe of Bi≈øhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> which we here publi≈øh, will conduce mo≈øt, by rea≈øon of the great and eminent Authority of the Author, which was ≈øo highly con≈øiderable beyond that of any other Reformer, that he may ju≈øtly be e≈øteemed the Standard of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at that time. Not only the a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his great learning and eminent ≈øtation in the Church, renders this probable; but that great part which he had in managing the Affairs of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary deference paid to his Authority, and tru≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed in him by all Convocations, and the whole body of the Reformers, demon≈øtrate it. None can rea≈øonably be put in competition with him, except Archbi≈øhop <hi>Cranmer;</hi> and he al≈øo in his di≈øputation at <hi>Oxford</hi> profe≈ø≈øed, that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Opinion concerning the <hi>Euchari≈øt</hi> from Bi≈øhop <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi> This the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Clergy were ≈øo ≈øen≈øible of in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that by a plau≈øible calumny they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to per≈øuade the World, that the private opinion of

            </p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Fecknam</hi> hath truly repre≈øented the words of <hi>Ridley,</hi> is uncertain. But from the la≈øt words of this pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage it is manife≈øt, that ≈øome, even in that time, taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion from this Sermon, had charged Bi≈øhop <hi>Ridley</hi> with a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerting a Material Pre≈øence of Chri≈øt's Body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb facs="tcp:46245:5"/>
and that he con≈øtantly denied him≈øelf to have meant or intended any ≈øuch pre≈øence. In this therefore, and ≈øuch like expre≈ø≈øions, he intended only (as him≈øelf a≈ø≈øures us) to oppo≈øe tho≈øe, who <hi>≈øo lightly e≈øteemed the Sacrament,</hi>

For which cau≈øes, I, to rebuke the unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend behaviour of certain evil di≈øpo≈øed per≈øons, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as reverendly of that Matter, as I might, declaring what e≈øtimation and reverence ought to be given to it; what danger en≈øued the mi≈ø-handling thereof; affirming in that Sacrament to be truly and verily the Body and Blood of Chri≈øt, effectually by Grace and Spirit. Which words the unlearned under≈øtanding not, ≈øuppo≈øed that I had meant of the gro≈øs and carnal being, which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh Decrees ≈øet forth, That a Body having life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øhould be indeed under the ≈øhapes of Bread and Wine.</hi>

               <hi>MANY</hi> things confounde a weake memory: A few places wel weighed and perceiued, lighten the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding. Trueth is there to be ≈øearched, where it is certain to be had, though God dooth ≈øpeake the trueth by man, yet in mans woord, which God hath not reuealed to be his, a man may doubt without mi≈øtru≈øt in God. Chri≈øte is the trueth of God reuealed vnto man from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by God him ≈øelf, and therefore in his woord the trueth is to be founde, which is to be embraced of al that be his. Chri≈øt biddeth vs a≈øke, and we ≈øhall haue: ≈øearch and we ≈øhall finde: knocke, and it ≈øhall be opened unto vs. Therefore our Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The ble≈ø≈øed Martirs praier.</note> Father, the Author and fountain of al trueth, the bottomles Sea of al vnder≈øtanding, ≈øend down we be≈øeech th√©e, thy holy ≈øpirit into our harts, and lighten our vnder≈øtanding with the beames of thy heauenly grace. We ask th√©e this, O mercifull Father, not in re≈øpect of our de≈øerts, but for thy d√©ere Sonne our Sauiour Ie≈øus Chri≈øts ≈øake. Thou knowe≈øt, O heauenly Father, that the controuer≈øie about the Sacrament of the ble≈ø≈øed body and blood of thy d√©er Sonne our Sauiour Ie≈øu Chri≈øte, hath troubled not of late onlye the Churche of <hi>England, Fraunce, Germanie,</hi> and <hi>Italye,</hi> but al≈øo many y√©ere agoe. The fault is ours (na dout) therfore, for we have de≈øerued thy plague. But (O Lord) be mercifull, and rel√©eue our mi≈øerie with ≈øome lighte of grace. Thou knowe≈øt (O Lord) how this wicked world rolleth vp and down, and r√©eleth to and fro, and careth not what thy will is, ≈øo it may abide in wealth. If trueth haue wealthe, who are ≈øo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46245:9"/>
≈øtoute to defende the trueth, as they? But if Chri≈øtes cro≈ø≈øe be laid on trueths back, then they vani≈øh away ≈øtraight, as Waxe before the fier. But the≈øe are not they, O Heauenly Father, for whome I make my mo≈øte moane, but for tho≈øe ≈øilly ones, O Lord, which haue a zeale vnto th√©e: tho≈øe I mean, which wold <note place="margin">Note.</note> and wi≈øh to know thy wil, and yet are letted, holden backe, and blinded by the ≈øubtilties of Sathan and his mini≈øters, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes of this wretched worlde, and the ≈øinfull lu≈øts and affections of the fle≈øh. Alas Lord, thou knowe≈øt that we b√©e of our ≈øelues but fle≈øh, wherein there dwelleth nothing that is good. How then is it po≈ø≈øible for man without th√©e (O Lord) to vnder≈øtand thy trueth ind√©ed? Can the naturall man perceiue the wil of God? (O Lord) to whom thou giue≈øt a zeale of th√©e, giue them al≈øo (we be≈øeech th√©e) the knowledge of thy ble≈ø≈øed wil. Suffer not them (O Lord) blindely to be led for to ≈øtriue again≈øt th√©e: as thou didde≈øt tho≈øe (Alas) which crucified thine own Sonne, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them (O Lord) for thy d√©ere Sonnes ≈øake, for they know not what they doo. They doo think (Alas, O Lord) for lack of knowledge, that they doo vnto th√©e good ≈øeruice euen when again≈øt th√©e they doo mo≈øte extremelye rage. Remember, O Lord, (we be≈ø√©ech thee) for whome thy Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> did praye, and whome thyne holy Apo≈øtle <hi>Paule</hi> did ≈øo truelye and earne≈øtlye loue: that for their ≈øaluation, h√©e wi≈øhed him≈øelf accur≈øed for them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (O heauenly Father) the prayer of thy d√©ere Sonne, our Sauiour Chri≈øte vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, when be ≈øaide vnto th√©e, <hi>O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiue them, they know not what they doo.</hi> With this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes, O good Lord, giue me, I be≈ø√©ech th√©e, thy grace, ≈øo h√©er br√©efly to ≈øet foorth the ≈øayings of thy Sonne our Sauiour Chri≈øte, and of his Euangeli≈øtes, and of his Apo≈øtles, that in this afore≈øaid controuer≈øie, the lighte of the trueth, by the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of thy woord, may ≈øhine vnto all them that loue th√©e.</p>
            <p>Of the Lords la≈øt ≈øupper doo ≈øpeak expre≈ølye the Euangeli≈øts, <hi>Mathew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke:</hi> but none more plainelye nor more fully declareth the ≈øame, then dooth S. <hi>Paule,</hi> partely in the tenth Chapter, but ≈øpecially in the xj. chapter of his fir≈øt epi≈øtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> As <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> doo agr√©e much in woordes, ≈øo doo likewi≈øe <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Paule.</hi> But all iiij. no doubte, as they were all taught in one ≈øchoole, and in≈øpired with one ≈øpirit, ≈øo taught they as one trueth. God grant vs to vnder≈øtande it wel. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mathew</hi> ≈øetteth foorth Chri≈øtes Supper thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When euen was come, he ≈øat down with the xij. &amp;c. As they did eat, Je≈øus took bread and gave thankes, brake it, and gave it to the di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 26.</note> 
               <hi>and ≈øaide: Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46245:9"/>
               <hi>and gaue thankes, gaue it to them, ≈øaying, Drink ye al of this: for this is my blood of the newe te≈øtament that is ≈øhed for many for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes, I ≈øay vnto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine tree, untill that daye, when I ≈øhall drink that newe in my fathers kingdome. And when they had ≈øayed grace they went out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Mark</hi> ≈øpeaketh it thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as they eate, Je≈øus took bread, ble≈ø≈øed, and brake, and gaue to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>them and ≈øaied, take, eat, this is my body. And took the cup gaue thankes, and gaue it to them, and they all drank of it. And he ≈øaid vnto them: This is my bloud of the new te≈øtament, which is ≈øhed for many. Verily I ≈øaye vnto you, I wil drink no more of the fruit of the vine, vntill that day, that I drink that newe, in the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>H√©ere <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> doo agree not only in the matter, but al≈øo almo≈øte fully in the forme of woords. In <hi>Mathew,</hi> gaue thankes. <hi>Mark</hi> hath one woorde, Ble≈ø≈øed: which ≈øignifieth in this place al one. And where <hi>Mathew</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Drink ye al of this, Mark</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>they al drank of it.</hi> And where <hi>Mathew</hi> ≈øaithe, <hi>of this fruit of the vine; Mark</hi> leaueth out the woord <hi>this,</hi> and ≈øaith, <hi>of the fruit of the vine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us ≈øee likewi≈øe, what agr√©ement (in forme of woords) is betw√©ene S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Paule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke</hi> writeth thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He took bread, gaue thankes, brake it and gaue it to them, ≈øaying;</hi>

               <hi>this is my body which is giuen for you, this doo in remembrance of me. Likewi≈øe al≈øo when they had ≈øupped, he took the Cup, ≈øaying, this Cup is the newe Te≈øtament in my bloud, which is ≈øhedde for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ≈øetteth foorth the Lords Supper thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord Ie≈øus, the ≈øame night, in the which he was betraied, took</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>Bread, and gaue thankes and brake, and ≈øaide, take, eate, this is my body which is broken for you. This doo in remembrance of me. After the ≈øame maner he took the Cup, when ≈øupper was doon, ≈øaying, this Cup is the new te≈øtament in my bloud. This doo as often as yee ≈øhall drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye ≈øhall eate this breade, and drinke this cup, ye ≈øhall ≈øhewe the Lords deathe, vntill he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>H√©ere where S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øaith, which is <hi>given; Paule</hi> ≈øaith, which is <hi>broken.</hi> And as <hi>Luke</hi> addeth to the woordes of <hi>Paule</hi> ≈øpoken of the Cup which is ≈øhed for you, ≈øo likewi≈øe <hi>Paule</hi> addeth to the woords thereof, <hi>this doo, as often as yee ≈øhall drinke it, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> The re≈øt that followeth in S. <hi>Paule,</hi> both there and in the tenth Chapter, perteineth unto the right v≈øe of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>Thus the Euangeli≈øtes and S. <hi>Paule</hi> haue rehear≈øed the woords and woorke of Chri≈øte, whereby he did in≈øtitute and ordaine this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46245:10"/>
holy Sacrament of his bodye and blood to be a perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance vnto his comming againe of him ≈øelfe, I ≈øay that is of his body giuen for vs, and of his blood ≈øhed for the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes. But this remembrance which to thus ordained, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof is Chri≈øte, bothe God and Man, ≈øo by the almightye power of God, if far pa≈ø≈øeth al kindes of remembrances, that any other man is able to make either of him ≈øelfe, or of any other thinge. For who≈øoever receiueth this holy Sacrament thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined in remembrance of Chri≈øte, he receiueth therwith either death or life. In this (I tru≈øt) we doo al agr√©e, For S. <hi>Paule</hi> ≈øaith of the godly receiuers in the tenth Chapter of his fir≈øt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle vnto the <hi>Cerinthians, The Cup of ble≈ø≈øinge, which we ble≈ø≈øe, is it not the pertaking or felow≈øhip of Chri≈øtes bloud?</hi> And al≈øo ≈øaithe, <hi>the Breade which wee break</hi> (and meaneth at the Lords Lable) <hi>Is it not the partaking or felow≈øhip of Chri≈øts body?</hi> Now the partaking of Chri≈øtes body and of his blood vnto the faithfull and godly, is the partaking or felow≈øhip of life and immortalitie. And againe of the bad and vngodly receiuers, S. <hi>Paule</hi> as plainly ≈øaith thus. <hi>He that eateth of this bread, and drinketh of this cup vnworthily, is gilty of the body and bloud of the Lord.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Note.</note>
            </p>
            <p>O how nece≈ø≈øary then it is, if we loue life, and would e≈øchue deathe, to trye and examine our ≈øelues, before we eate of this bread, and drink of this cup, for els a≈ø≈øuredly, he that eateth and drinketh thereof vnworthilye, eateth and drinketh his own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becau≈øe he e≈øt√©emeth not the Lords body, that is, he reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth not the Lordes bodye with the honour that is due vnto him.</p>
            <p>And that which was ≈øaide, that with the receite of the holye Sacrament of the ble≈ø≈øed body and bloud of Chri≈øte is receiued of every one, good and bad, either life or death: it is not ment, that they whiche are dead before God, may heerby receiue life: or the liuinge before God, can heerby receiue death.</p>
            <p>For as none is meete to receiue naturall food, wherby the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life is nouri≈øhed, except he be borne and liue before: ≈øo no man can feed (by the receit of this holy Sacrament) of the food of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, except he be regenerated and borne of God before. And on the other ≈øide, no man heer receiueth damnation whiche is not dead before. Thus hethertoo without al doubt, God is my witne≈ø≈øe I ≈øaye ≈øo far as I doo knowe, there is no controuer≈øie amonge them that be learned, in the Churche of <hi>England</hi> (concerninge the matter of this Sacrament) but al doo agree, whether they be new or olde, and to ≈øpeak plain, and as ≈øome of them doo odiou≈øly cal either other, whether they be Prote≈øtantes, Papi≈øts, Phari≈øies or Go≈øpellers. And as all doo agree hithertoo, in the afore≈øaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46245:10"/>
≈øo all doo dete≈øte, abborre and condemne the wicked he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øie of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øalonians</hi> which otherwi≈øe be called <hi>Eutichets,</hi> which ≈øaide that the holy Sacrament can neither doo no good nor harme. All do al≈øo condemne tho≈øe wicked Anabapti≈øtes, which put no difference between the Lords Table and the Lords meat, and their owne. And becau≈øe charity would, that we ≈øhould, (if it be po≈ø≈øible, and ≈øo far as we may with the ≈øauegarde of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and maintenance of the trueth) agree with all men: therfore me thinkes it is not charitablye doon to burthen any man (either newe or olde, as they call them) further, then ≈øuch doo declare them≈øelues, to di≈ø≈øent from that we are per≈øwaded to be trueth, or pretend thertoo to be controuer≈øies, where as none ≈øuch are in deed: and ≈øo to multiply the debate, the which the more it doth increa≈øe, the further it doth depart from the vnitie, that the true Chri≈øtian ≈øhould de≈øire.</p>
            <p>And again this is true, that trueth nother needeth nor wil be <note place="margin">What it is to lye. The ≈ølaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lyes of the Papi≈øts.</note> maintained with lies. It is al≈øo a true prouerb, <hi>That it is euen ≈øinne to lye vpon the Deuil.</hi> For though by thy lye thou doo≈øt neuer ≈øo much ≈øpeak again≈øt the Deuil, yet in that thou lie≈øt in deed thou woorke≈øt the Deuils woorke, thou doo≈øt him ≈øeruice, and take≈øt the Deuils part. Now whether then they doo godlye and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablye, which either by their Pen in Writing, or by their Woordes in Preaching, doo beare the ≈øimple people in hand, that tho≈øe which thus doo teach and beleue, doo go about to make the holye Sacrament (ordeined by Chri≈øte him≈øelfe) a thing no better then a peece of common Bread: or that doo ≈øaye, that ≈øuch doo make the holye Sacrament of the ble≈ø≈øed bodye and blood of Chri≈øte, nothing els but a bare ≈øigne or a figure, to repre≈øent Chri≈øte none otherwi≈øe, then the Ivye bu≈øhe doth repre≈øent the Wine in a Tauern, or as a vile per≈øon gorgiou≈ølye apparalled, maye repre≈øent a King or a Prince in a playe. Alas let men leaue lying, and ≈øpeak trueth everye one, not only to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but al≈øo of his neighboure, for wee are members one of an other ≈øaith Saint <hi>Paule.</hi> The controuer≈øie (no doubt) which at this daye troubleth the Church (wherin any mean learned man, either olde or newe, dooth ≈øtand in) is not, whether the holy Sacrament of the body and blood of Chri≈øte, is no better then a peece of common breade or no: or whether the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is no more to be regarded, then the Table of any earthly man or no: or whether it is but a bare ≈øigne or figure of Chri≈øte and nothing el≈øe or no. For all do graunt, that S. <hi>Paules</hi> woordes doo require, that the bread which we break, is the partaking of the body of Chri≈øte, and al≈øo doo graunte him that eateth of that bread, or drinketh of that cup vnwoorthely, to be gilty of the

Lords death, and to eate and drinke his owne damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe be e≈øteemeth not the Lords body. All doo graunt, that the≈øe woords of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> (when he ≈øaith: <hi>If we eate. it aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs nothing: or if wee eate not, wee want nothing therby)</hi> are not ≈øpoken of the Lords Table, but of other common meats.</p>
            <p>Thus then betherto yet, we all agree. But now let vs ≈øee, <note place="margin">Wherin the controuerfie con≈øi≈øteth.</note> wherin the di≈ø≈øention doth ≈øtand. The vnder≈øtanding of it, wherin it cheeflye ≈øtandeth, is a ≈øtep to the true ≈øearching foorthe of the trueth. For who can ≈øeeke well a remedye, if he knowe not before the di≈øea≈øe? It is neither to be denied nor di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembled, that in the matter of this Sacrament there be diuers poyntes, wherin men (counted to be learned) cannot agree. As, whether there be any Tran≈øub≈øtantiation of the bread, or no: any corporall and carnall pre≈øence of Chri≈øtes ≈øub≈øtance, or no. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adoration (due only vnto God) is to be doon vnto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or no? and whether Chri≈øtes bodye be there offered in deed vnto the heauenly Father, by the Pree≈øte or no? and whether the euill man receiueth the naturall body of Chri≈øte or no. Yet neuertheles as in a man di≈øea≈øed in diuers partes, commonly the originall cau≈øe of ≈øuch diuers di≈øea≈øes which is ≈øpred abroad in the body, doo come from one cheefe member, as from the ≈øtomacke, or from the head, euen ≈øo all fiue afore≈øaid doo chiefly hange vpon this one que≈øtion, which is, <hi>What is the matter of the Sacrament?</hi> whether is it the naturall ≈øub≈øtance of bread, or the naturall ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of Chri≈øts owne body? The trueth of this que≈øtion truelye tried out and agreed vpon, no doubt ≈øhall cea≈øe the controuer≈øie in all the re≈øt. For if it be Chri≈øtes owne natural body, born of the Virgin: then a≈ø≈øuredlye (≈øeeing that all learned men in <hi>England</hi> ≈øo far as I knowe, bothe newe and olde, graunt there to be but one ≈øub≈øtance, then I ≈øay, they mu≈øt needs graunt Tran≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation: that is, a change of the ≈øub≈øtance of breade, into the ≈øub≈øtance of Chri≈øtes bodye. Then al≈øo they mu≈øt needs graunt the carnal and corporal pre≈øence of Chri≈øtes body. Then mu≈øt the Sacrament be adorred with the honour due to Chri≈øte him ≈øelfe, for the vnitie of the two natures in one per≈øon. Then if the Pree≈øt do offer the Sacrament, he dooth offer indeed Chri≈øte him ≈øelf. And finally the murtherer, the aduouterer, or wicked man receiuinge the Sacrament, mu≈øte needes then receiue al≈øo the naturall ≈øub≈øtance of Chri≈øtes owne ble≈ø≈øed bodye, bothe fle≈øhe and blood.</p>
            <p>Now on the other ≈øide, if after the trueth ≈øhal be truely tried out, it ≈øhall be found, that the ≈øub≈øtance of breade is the naturall ≈øub≈øtance of the Sacrament, although for the change of the v≈øe, office and dignitie of the bread, the bread indeed Sacramentally
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46245:11"/>
is changed into the bodye of Chri≈øte, as the water in Bapti≈øme is ≈øacramentally changed into the fountaine of regeneration, and yet the natural ≈øub≈øtance therof remaineth al one, as was before: if I ≈øaye the true ≈øolucion of that former que≈øtion (wherupon all the≈øe controuer≈øies doo hang) be, that the natural ≈øub≈øtance of bread, is the materiall ≈øub≈øtance in the Sacrament of Chri≈øtes ble≈ø≈øed body: then mu≈øt it needes followe of the former propo≈øition (confe≈ø≈øed of al that be named to be learned, ≈øo far as I doo knowe, in <hi>England)</hi> whiche is that there is but one materiall ≈øub≈øtance in the Sacrament of the body, and one only likewi≈øe in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the blood, that there is no ≈øuch thinge indeede and in truethe, as they call Tran≈øub≈øtantiation: for the ≈øub≈øtance of bread remaineth ≈øtil in the Sacrament of the body, then al≈øo the naturall ≈øub≈øtance of Chri≈øtes humain nature, which he took of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is in Heauen, where it reigneth now in glory, and not heer inclo≈øed vnder the forme of bread, then the godly honour, which is onely due vnto God the creator, may not be doon vnto the creature without idolatrye and ≈øacrilege, is not to be doon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holye Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Then al≈øo the wicked, I mean the impenitent murtherrer, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uluterer, or ≈øuche like, doo not receiue the naturall ≈øub≈øtance of the ble≈ø≈øed body and blood of Chri≈øte. Finally, then dooth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that Chri≈øtes ble≈ø≈øed body and blood, which was once onlye offered and ≈øhed vpon the Cro≈ø≈øe, beinge auaylable for the ≈øinnes of all the whole world, is offered vp no more, in the naturall ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance therof, nother by the Pree≈øt, nor any other thing. But heer before wee go any further to ≈øearch in this matter, and to wade (as it were) to ≈øearch and trye out (as we may) the trueth heerof in the Scripture, it ≈øhall doo well by the way to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they that thus make an≈øwere and ≈øolucione vnto the former principall que≈øtion, doo take away ≈øimply and ab≈øolutely the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of Chri≈øtes bodye and blood, from the Sacrament ordeined by Chri≈øte, and dulye mini≈øtred according to his holy ordinance and in≈øtitution of the ≈øame. Vndoubtedly they doo deny that btterlye, either ≈øo to ≈øaye, or ≈øo to meane. Heerof if any man doo or will doubt, the bookes which are written already in this matter of them, that thus doo an≈øwere, will make the matter plaine.</p>
            <p>Now then will you ≈øaye, what kinde of pre≈øence doo they graunt, and what doo they denye? Breeflye they deny the pre≈øence of Chri≈øts body in the naturall ≈øub≈øtance of his humain and a≈ø≈øumpt nature, and graunt the pre≈øence of the ≈øame by grace: that is, they affirme and ≈øaye, that the ≈øub≈øtance of the naturall bodye and blood of Chri≈øte is only remaining in Heaven, and ≈øo ≈øhall

            <p>I doo prote≈øte al≈øo due obedience &amp; ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of my iudgemente in this my writing, and in all other mine affairs vnto tho≈øe of Chri≈øts Church, which be truly learned in Gods holy Woord, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in Chri≈øts Name and guided by his Spirit.

            <p>Fir≈øte let vs repete the beginninge of the in≈øtitution of the Lords Supper wherin all the three Euangeli≈øts, and S. <hi>Paule</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt in woords doo agree, ≈øaying that <hi>Ie≈øus took bread, gaue thanks, brake, and gaue it to the Di≈øciples ≈øayinge: Take, eate, this is my bodye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heer it appeareth plainly, that Chri≈øte calleth very bread his body. For that which he took, was very bread. In this all men doo agree. And that which he took, after he had giuen thankes, he brake: and that which he took and brake, he gaue to his di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and that which be took, brake, and gaue to his Di≈øciples he ≈øaide him ≈øelfe of it: <hi>This is my body.</hi> So it appeareth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye that Chri≈øt called very bread his body. But very bread canot be his bodye in very ≈øub≈øtance therof: therfore it mu≈øt needs haue an other meaninge. Which meaninge appeareth plainelye what it is, by the next ≈øentence that followeth immediatly, both in <hi>Luke</hi> and in <hi>Paule.</hi> And that is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doo this in remembrance of me.</hi> Wher-vpon it ≈øeemeth vnto me to be euident, that Chri≈øte did take bread, and called it his bodye, for that he would therby in≈øtitute a perpetuall remembrance of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46245:13"/>
his body: ≈øpeciallye of the ≈øinguler benefite of our redemtion, which he would then procure and purcha≈øe vnto vs by his bodye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cro≈ø≈øe. But bread retaining ≈øtill his owne very naturall ≈øub≈øtance, may be thus by grace, (and in a ≈øacramental ≈øignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) his body: wheras els the very bread which he took, brake, and gaue them, could not be any wi≈øe his naturall bodye. For that were confu≈øion of ≈øub≈øtances, and therfore the very woordes of Chri≈øte ioynes with the next ≈øentence following, both enforceth vs to confe≈ø≈øe the verye bread, to remaine ≈øtill, and al≈øo openeth vnto vs, how that bread maye be and is thus by his deuine power his body, which was giuen for vs. But heere I remember I haue red in ≈øome writers of the contrarye opinion, which Chri≈øte did take, be brake. For ≈øay they, after his taking, he ble≈ø≈øed it as <hi>Mark</hi> dooth ≈øpeak. And by his ble≈ø≈øing, be changed the natural ≈øub≈øtance of the bread into the natural ≈øub≈øtance of his body: and ≈øo although he took the bread, and ble≈ø≈øed it, yet becau≈øe in ble≈ø≈øing he changed the ≈øub≈øtance of it, he brake not the breade, which then was not there, but only the forme therof.</p>
            <p>Vnto this obiection I haue two plain an≈øwers, both grounded vpon Gods woord. The one I will heer rehear≈øe, the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer I will differ, vntil I ≈øpeak of the Sacrament of the blood. Mine an≈øwere heer is taken out of the plaine woords of S. <hi>Paule</hi> which dooth manife≈øtly confound this fanta≈øtical inuention, fir≈øt inuented (I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But what can crafty inuention, ≈øubtiltye in ≈øophi≈ømes, eloquence or finene≈ø≈øe of wit <note place="margin">Mar. Antho. Con≈øtan. Gardenar.</note> preuaile again≈øt the vnfallible Woorde of God? What neede we to ≈øtriue and contend what thinge we break, for <hi>Paule</hi> ≈øaieth, ≈øpeaking vndoubtedly of the Lords Table: <hi>The bread</hi> (≈øaieth he) <hi>which we break, is it not the partaking or felow≈øhip of the Lords body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherupon it followeth, that after the thanks giving it is bread which we break. And how often in the <hi>Acts of the Apo≈øtles</hi> is the Lords Supper ≈øignified by breaking of bread? <hi>They did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeuer</hi> (≈øaith S. <hi>Luke) in the Apo≈øtles Doctrine, Communion, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>breaking of bread. And they brake breade in euery hou≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again in an other place when they were come together to breake bread, &amp;c. S. <hi>Paule</hi> which ≈øetteth foorth mo≈øte fully in his writinge both the doctrine and the right v≈øe of the Lords Supper, and the Sacramentall eating and drinkinge of Chri≈øts body and blood, calleth it fiue times bread, bread, bread, bread, bread.</p>
            <p>The ≈øacramentall bread is the mi≈øticall body, and ≈øo it is called <note place="margin">The ≈øecond rea≈øon.</note> in Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. as it is called the naturall body of Chri≈øte.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46245:13"/>
But Chri≈øts mi≈øticall body is the congregation of Chri≈øtians. Now no man was euer ≈øo fond, as to ≈øay, that that ≈øacramentall breade is tran≈øub≈øtantiated and changed into the ≈øub≈øtance of the congregatione. Wherfore no man ≈øhoulde likewi≈øe think, or ≈øaye, that the breade is tran≈øub≈øtantiated and changed into the naturall ≈øub≈øtance of Chri≈øtes humaine nature.</p>
            <p>But my minde is not h√©ere to write what may be gathered out of Scriptures for this purpo≈øe, but onely to note heer breefly, tho≈øe which ≈øeem vnto me, to be the mo≈øt plaine places.

            <p>And this ≈øhall be my third Argument grounded vpon Chri≈øtes <note place="margin">The third Argument.</note> owne woordes. The natural ≈øub≈øtance of the ≈øacramentall Wine remaineth ≈øtill, and is the material ≈øub≈øtance of the Sacrament of the blood of Chri≈øte: Therfore it is likewi≈øe ≈øo in the ≈øacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Bread.</p>
            <p>I know that he that is of a contrarye opinion, will denye the former parte of mine Argument. But I will prooue it thus by the plaine woords of Chri≈øte him≈øelfe, both in <hi>Mathewe</hi> and in <hi>Marke.</hi> Chri≈øtes woordes are the≈øe: after the wordes ≈øaide vpon the cup: <hi>I ≈øaye vnto you,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øte, <hi>I will not drinke hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorthe of this fruite of the vine tree, vntill I ≈øhall drink that new in my fathers kingdome.</hi> Heere note how Chri≈øte calleth plainly his cup the fruit of the vine tree. But the fruit of the vine is very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wine. Wherfore the naturall ≈øub≈øtance of the wine doothe remaine ≈øtill in the Sacrament of Chri≈øtes Blood.</p>
            <p>And heer in ≈øpeaking of the Lords Cup: it commeth vnto my remembrance the vanitie of <hi>Innocentius</hi> his fanta≈øticall inuention, which by <hi>Paules</hi> woordes I did confute before, and h√©er did promi≈øe ≈øomwhat more to ≈øpeake, and that is this: if this Tran≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatione be made by this woorde, Ble≈ø≈øed, in <hi>Mark</hi> ≈øaid vpon the breade, as <hi>Innocentius</hi> that Pope did ≈øaye: then ≈øurely ≈øeeing that woord is not ≈øaide of Chri≈øte neither in any of the Euangeli≈øtes nor in S. <hi>Paule</hi> vpon the cup: There is no Tran≈øub≈øtantiatione of the Wine at all. For where the cau≈øe dooth falle, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow the effect. But the ≈øacramental Bread and the ≈øacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Wine doo both remain in their naturall ≈øub≈øtance a like, and if the one be not changed, as of the ≈øacramental Wine it appeareth euidently: then there is no ≈øuch Tran≈øub≈øtantiatione in nother of them both.</p>
            <p>All that tru≈øt and affirme this change of the ≈øub≈øtance of breade <note place="margin">The Papi≈øts, affirme they wot not what.</note> and mine into the ≈øub≈øtance of Chri≈øtes Bodye and Blood called Tran≈øub≈øtantiation: doo al≈øo ≈øay this change to be made by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forme of pre≈øcripte woordes, and none other.

            <p>And as for tho≈øe ≈øacramentall woords of the order of Pr√©e≈øthood, to haue authoritie to ≈øacrifice both for the quicke and the deade, I w√©ene <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> (if they were both a liue) were not able to prooue, that euer Chri≈øte gaue them ≈øuch authoritie, or euer ≈øaid any ≈øuch woordes vnto them. But I will let <hi>Luke</hi> goe, and becau≈øe <hi>Paule</hi> ≈øpeaketh more for him ≈øelfe: I will rehear≈øe his woords: <hi>That (≈øaith Paule) whiche I receiued of the Lord, I gaue vnto you.

            <p>Now then, if you graunt mee, that <hi>Paule</hi> did v≈øe the forme of woords, which he writeth: Let vs then rehear≈øe and con≈øider <hi>Paules</hi> woorde, which he ≈øaith, Chri≈øt ≈øpake thus vpon the Cuppe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>H√©er I woulde knowe, whether that Chri≈øts woords ≈øpoken vpon the cup were not as mighty in woork, and as effectuall in ≈øignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all intentes, con≈øtrictions, and <hi>purpo≈øes,</hi> (as all our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament men doo ≈øpeak) as they were ≈øpoken vpon the breade. If this be graunted, which thinge I think no man can deny: then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I rea≈øon thus. But the woorde <hi>(Is)</hi> in the woords ≈øpoken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lords breade dooth mightely ≈øignifie (≈øay they) the change of the ≈øub≈øtance of that which goeth before it into the ≈øub≈øtance of that which followeth after, that is, of the ≈øub≈øtance of bread into the ≈øub≈øtance of Chri≈øtes bodye, when Chri≈øte ≈øaith: <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Now then if Chri≈øts woords which are ≈øpoken vpon the cup, which <hi>Paule</hi> heere rehear≈øeth be of the ≈øame might and power, both in woorking and ≈øignifying: then mu≈øt this woord <hi>(Is)</hi> when Chri≈øte ≈øaithe: <hi>This Cup is the new Te≈øtament, &amp;c.</hi> turne the ≈øub≈øtance of the cup into the ≈øub≈øtance of the new te≈øtament. And if thou wilt ≈øaye, that this woorde <hi>(Is)</hi> nother maketh nor ≈øignifieth any ≈øuch change of the cup, Although it be ≈øaid of Chri≈øte, that this cup is the new te≈øtament, yet Chri≈øt ment no ≈øuch change as that. Marry ≈øir, euen ≈øo ≈øaye I, when Chri≈øte ≈øaid of the bread, which h√©e took, and after thanks giuen, brake, and gaue them, ≈øaying: <hi>Take, eat, this is my body,</hi> he ment no more any ≈øuch change of the ≈øub≈øtance of breade into the ≈øub≈øtance of his naturall body, then he ment of the change and tran≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtamiation of the cup into the ≈øub≈øtance of the newe Tellament. And if thou wilt ≈øaye that the woord <hi>(Cup)</hi> h√©er in Chri≈øts woords dooth not ≈øignifie the Cup it ≈øelf, but the Wine or thing centeined in the cup, by a figure called <hi>Metonymia,</hi> for that Chri≈øts <note place="margin">Note well the Papi≈øts errour con≈øuted.</note> woordes ≈øo ment, and mu≈øte n√©eds be taken: thou ≈øai≈øt very wel. But I pray th√©e by the way, h√©er note two things, Fir≈øt that this woorde, <hi>Is,</hi> hath no ≈øuche ≈øtrength or ≈øignification in the Lordes woords, to make or to ≈øignifie any tran≈øub≈øtanciation. Secondly, that the Lords woords wherby he in≈øtituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his blood: he v≈øeth a figuratiue ≈øpeach. How vaine then is it, that ≈øome ≈øo earne≈øtly doo ≈øay, as it were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule, that in doctrine and in the in≈øtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chri≈øte v≈øed no figurs, but all his woordes are to be

≈øtrained to their proper ≈øignifications: when as h√©er what ≈øoeuer thou ≈øaie≈øt was in the cup, nother that nor the cup it ≈øelf, taking eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye woorde in his proper ≈øignification, was the new te≈øtament, but in vnder≈øtanding that which was in the cup by the cup that is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue ≈øpeache: yea and al≈øo thou can≈øt not verifie or truly ≈øay of that whether thou ≈øaie≈øt it was wine or Chri≈øts bloud, to be the new te≈øtament without a figure al≈øo. Thus in one ≈øentence ≈øpoken of Chri≈øte, in the in≈øtitution of the Sacrament of his bloud, the figure mu≈øt help vs twi≈øe. So vntrue it is, that ≈øome doo write, that Chri≈øte v≈øeth no figure in the doctrine of faith, nor in the in≈øtitution of his ≈øacraments. But ≈øome ≈øay, if we ≈øhall thus admit figures in doctrine: then ≈øhall all the articles of our faith, by figures and allegories ≈øhortly be transformed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øed.

The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer whereof is, that <hi>Origen</hi> in this place ≈øpake not of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of bread or wine of the Lords table, but of an other mi≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call meat: of the which S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> maketh mencion to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them, that were taught the faithe, before they were bapti≈øed. But <hi>Origens</hi> owne woordes in two ≈øentences before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear≈øed being put togither, prooue this an≈øwere vntrue. For he ≈øaith, that he meaneth of that figuratiue and mi≈øticall bodye, which profiteth them, that doo receiue it woorthilye, alludinge ≈øo plainelye vnto S. <hi>Paules</hi> woords ≈øpoken of the Lords Supper: that it is a ≈øhame for any learned man once to open his mouth to the contrarye. And that breade which S. <hi>Augu≈øtin</hi> ≈øpeaketh of, he can not proue that any ≈øuche thing was v≈øed in <hi>Origens</hi> time. Yea and though that coulde bee proued, yet was there neuer breade in any time called a ≈øacramentall body, ≈øauing the ≈øacramentall bread of the Lords table, which is called of <hi>Origen</hi> the typicall and ≈øymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall body of Chri≈øte.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond of the two new found an≈øwers, is yet mo≈øte mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrous <note place="margin">Gardener in the ≈øame place.</note> of al other, which is this. <hi>But let vs graunt</hi> (≈øay they) <hi>that</hi> Origen <hi>≈øpake of the Lordes Supper, and by the matter therof was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanded the materiall ≈øub≈øtance of bread and wine:</hi> what then ≈øay they? <hi>For thoughe the materiall ≈øub≈øtance was once gone and departed by rea≈øon of Tran≈øub≈øtantiation, whils the formes of the bread and the wine did remaine, yet now it is no inconuenience to ≈øaye, that as the material ≈øub≈øtance did departe at the entring in of Chri≈øtes body vnder th' afore≈øaid formes, ≈øo whan the ≈øaid formes be de≈øtroyed and doo not remaine, then commeth again the ≈øub≈øtance of bread and wine.</hi>
            </p>

fanta≈øie: which not onelye lacketh al ground, either of Gods woord, rea≈øon, or of any ancient writer, but al≈øo is clean contrary to the common rules of ≈øchoole diuinitie: which is, that no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is to be affirmed and put without nece≈ø≈øitie.

But that to eate Chri≈øtes fle≈øhe dooth kill ≈øo vnder≈øtanded, <hi>Origen</hi> affirmeth plainly in his woordes aboue rebear≈øed: Wherefore it cannot be iu≈øtly denied, but to eate Chri≈øtes bodye literally vnder≈øtanded, mu≈øt n√©eds after him kill likewi≈øe.</p>
            <p>The an≈øwere that is made to this place of <hi>Origen</hi> of the Papi≈øts, is ≈øo fooli≈øh, that it be wraieth it ≈øelf, without any further confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is the ≈øame, that they make to a piace of S. <hi>Augu≈øtin</hi> in <note place="margin">

            <p>And fir≈øt I wil begin with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whom <hi>Ciprian</hi> the holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> ≈øo highly e≈øt√©emed, that when≈øoeuer he would haue his book, he was wonte to ≈øaye: Giue vs now the Mai≈øter.</p>
            <p>This olde writer in his fourthe booke again≈øt <hi>Martian</hi> the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, ≈øaith thus: <hi>Ie≈øus made the bread, which he tooke, and di≈øtributed to his di≈øciples, his body, ≈øaying: This is my body.

            </p>
            <p>In this place it is plaine, that after <hi>Tertullians</hi> expo≈øition, Chri≈øte mente not by callinge the breade his bodye, and the wine his blood, that either the breade was the naturall bodye, or the wine his natural blood, but he called them his bodye and blood, becau≈øe he would in≈øtitute them to be vnto vs Sacramentes: that is holye tokens and ≈øignes of his bodye and of his blood: that by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring and firmly belieuing the benefites procured to us by his body, which was torne and crucified for vs, and of his blood, which was ≈øhed for vs vpon the cro≈ø≈øe: and ≈øo with thanks receiuing the≈øe holy Sacramentes, according to Chri≈øtes in≈øtitution, might by the ≈øame be ≈øpiritually nouri≈øhed and fed to the increa≈øe of all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines in vs heere in our pilgrimage and iourney wherein we walke vnto euerla≈øting life.</p>
            <p>This was vndoubtedlye Chri≈øte our Sauiours mind, and this is <hi>Tertullians</hi> expo≈øition.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> writeth heere (≈øay they) as none hath deon hithertoo before him.</p>
            <p>This ≈øaying is too too manife≈øte fal≈øe: for <hi>Origene, Hilarye, Ambro≈øe, Ba≈øill, Grigorie, Nazianzene,</hi> Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> and other old authors, likewi≈øe doo call the ≈øacrament, a figure of Chri≈øtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. And where they ≈øay, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote this, when he was in a heate of di≈øputatione with an heretike, coueting by all means to ouerthrow his aduer≈øarye.

            <p>Likewi≈øe this author in his fir≈øt booke again≈øte the ≈øame here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike <hi>Martion,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>God did not reiect bread, which is his creature<hi>:</hi> for by it he hath made a repre≈øentation of his body.</hi>

Now I praye you, what is this to ≈øay that Chri≈øte hath made a repre≈øentation (by bread) of his body, but that Chri≈øt had in≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordeined bread to be a Sacrament, for to repre≈øent unto vs his body? Now whether the repre≈øentatione of one thing by an other, requireth the corporal pre≈øence of the thinge which is ≈øo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented or no: euerye man that hath vnder≈øtanding, is able in this poynte (the matter is ≈øo cleere of it ≈øelfe) to be a ≈øufficient iudge.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond doctour and writer of the Latin Churche, who≈øe <note place="margin">Augu≈øtine.</note> ≈øayinges I promi≈øed to ≈øet foorth, is S. <hi>Augu≈øtine.</hi> of who≈øe learning and e≈øtimation, I neede not to ≈øpeake. For all the Church of Chri≈øte both hath and euer hath had him for a man of mo≈øte ≈øingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler learning, witte, and dilligence, both in ≈øetting foorth the true doctrine of Chri≈øtes religion, and al≈øo in the defence of the ≈øame again≈øte heretikes.</p>
            <p>This author as he hath written mo≈øte plenteou≈øly in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our faith: ≈øo like wi≈øe in this argumente hee hath written at large in many of his woorkes, ≈øo plainly again≈øt this errour of Tran≈øub≈øtantiation, that the Papi≈øts loue lea≈øte to heare of him of all other writers, partely for his authoritie, and partely becau≈øe he openeth the matter more fully, then any other dooth.</p>
            <p>Therfore I will rehear≈øe more places of him then heertofore I haue doon of the other. And fir≈øt, what can be more plaine then that which he writeth vpon the 89. P≈øalme, ≈øpeaking of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords body and blood: and rehear≈øinge (as it were) Chri≈øtes woords to his Di≈øciples after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not this bodye, whiche ye doo ≈øee, that ye ≈øhall eate, nother ≈øhall ye drinke this blood, which the Souldiers that crucifie me, ≈øhall ≈øpill or ≈øhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I doo commend vnto you a mi≈øterye or a Sacrament, which ≈øpiritually vnder≈øtanded, ≈øhall give you life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Chri≈øte had no more naturall and corporall bodies, but that one which they then pre≈øently both heard and ≈øawe, nor other natural blood, but that which was in the ≈øame body, and the which the ≈øouldiers did afterward cruelly ≈øhed vpon the cro≈ø≈øe: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this bodye nor this bloode was (by this declaration of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øtine)</hi> either to be eaten or drunken, but the mi≈øterie thereof ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually to be vnder≈øtanded: then I conclude (if this ≈øaying and expo≈øition of S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> be true, that the mi≈øtery which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciples ≈øhould eate, was not the naturall body of Chri≈øt, but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery of the ≈øame ≈øpiritually to be under≈øtanded.</p>
            <p>For as S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaithe in his 20. book <hi>Contra Fau≈øtum. Ca.</hi> 21: <hi>Chri≈øtes fle≈øh and blood was in the olde Te≈øtament promi≈øed by ≈øimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and ≈øignes of their ≈øacrifices, and was exhibited indeed and in trueth vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, but the ≈øame is celebrated by a Sacrament of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance vpon the aulter.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:46245:22"/>
And in his book, <hi>De fide ad Petrum.

            <p>An other euident and cleer place wher in it appeareth, that by the Sacramental bread, which Chri≈øte called his bodye, he ment a figure of his body. As vpon the 3 P≈øalme, where S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øpeaketh this in plain termes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chri≈øte did admit Iudas vnto the fea≈øte, in the which he commended vnto his di≈øciples the figure of his body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was Chri≈øtes la≈øte Supper before his pa≈ø≈øion, wherin he did ordeine the ≈øacrament of his body, as all learned men do agree.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> al≈øo in his 23. Epi≈øtle to <hi>Bonifacius</hi> teacheth, how Sacraments doo beare the names of the thinges whereof they be Sacraments, both in Bapti≈øme, and in the Lords table, euen as we call euery good friday, the day of Chri≈øtes pa≈ø≈øion: and euery Ea≈øter daye, the daye of Chri≈øtes re≈øurrection: when in very deed there was but one day wherin he ≈øuffred, and but one day wherin he ro≈øe. And why doo we then call them ≈øo, which are not ≈øo indeede, but becau≈øe they are in like time and cour≈øe of the yeere, as tho≈øe days were, wherin tho≈øe thinges were doone?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Was Chri≈øte,</hi> ≈øaithe ≈øainte <hi>Augu≈øtine, offered any more but once? And he offered him≈øelf. And yet in a Sacramente or repre≈øentation not onelye euerye ≈øolemne fea≈øt of Ea≈øter, but al≈øo every daye to the People he is offered: ≈øo that he dooth not lye that ≈øaith: he is euery day offered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For if Sacraments had not ≈øome ≈øimilitude or likenes of tho≈øe things, whereof they be Sacraments, they coulde in no wi≈øe be Sacraments: and for their ≈øimilitudes or likenes: commonly they have the names of the things, whereof they be Sacraments. Therefore as after a certaine manner of ≈øpeech, the Sacrament of Chri≈øts body, is Chri≈øts body; the Sacramente of Chri≈øtes blood, is Chri≈øts bloode, ≈øo likewi≈øe the Sacrament of faith is faith.</hi>

            <p>In his 50. treatice, whiche he writeth vpon <hi>Iohn.</hi> he teacheth plainly and cleerly how Chri≈øte being both God and man, is both heer, after a certaine maner, and yet in heauen, and not heere in his naturall body and ≈øub≈øtance, which he took of the ble≈ø≈øed hirgin <hi>Mary:</hi> ≈øpeaking thus of Chri≈øte and ≈øayinge: <hi>By his deuine Maie≈øtie, by his prouidence and by his vn≈øpeakeable and inuincible grace that is fulfilled which he ≈øpake: Beholde, I am with you vnto the ende of the Worlde. But as concerning his fle≈øh which hee took in his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione, as touchinge that whiche was borne of the Virgine as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that whiche was apprehended by the Iewes and crucified vpon a tree, and taken down from the cro≈ø≈øe, lapped in linnen clothes, and buried, and ro≈øe againe, and appeared after his re≈øurrection, as concerninge the fle≈øhe, he ≈øaid; ye ≈øhall not ever haue me with you. Why ≈øo? For as concerning his fle≈øhe, he was conuer≈øant with his Di≈øciples xl. daies, and they accompanying, ≈øeeing and not following him, he wentvp into heaven, and is not heere. By the pre≈øence of his deuine maie≈øtie he did not departe; as concerninge the pre≈øence of his deuine maie≈øtie, we have Chri≈øte ever with us; but as concerninge the pre≈øence of his fle≈øh, he ≈øaid truely to his di≈øciples; ye ≈øhall not ever have me with you. For as concerninge the pre≈øence of his fle≈øhe, the Church had him but a few daies; nowe it holdeth him by Faith, though it ≈øe him not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øpeaketh repeating one thing ≈øo often: and all to declare and teach, how we ≈øhould vnder≈øtand the maner of Chri≈øtes beinge heere with vs: whiche is by his grace, by his providence, and by his deuine nature, and how he is ab≈øent by his naturall bodye whiche was born of the virgin Mary, died, &amp; ro≈øe for us, and is a≈ø≈øended into heauen, &amp; there ≈øitteth, as in the articles of our faith on the right hand of God, and thence (and from none other place ≈øaith S. <hi>Augu≈øtine)</hi> he ≈øhall come on the latter daye, to iudge the quick and the dead. At the which daye the righteous ≈øhall then lift up their heads, and the light of Gods trueth ≈øhal ≈øo ≈øhine: that fal≈øhood and errours ≈øhall be put into perpetuall confu≈øion: righteou≈ønes ≈øhall haue the vpper hand, and trueth that daye ≈øhall beare awaye the victorye, all th' enemies therof quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, to be troden vnder foot for euermore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:46245:23"/>
O Lord, Lord, I be≈øeech thee ha≈øten this day, then ≈øhalt thou be glorified with the glory due unto thy holy name, and unto thy deuine maie≈øty: and we ≈øhal ≈øing unto thee, in all ioy, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, laude and prai≈øe for euer mere. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>H√©er now would I make an end. For me thinks, S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> is in this matter ≈øo full and plaine, and of that authoritye, that it ≈øhould not n√©ed after this his declaration, being ≈øo firmelye grounded vpon Gods woorde, and ≈øo well agr√©einge with the other ancient Authors, to bring in for the confirmation of this matter any moe: and yet I ≈øaide, I would alleage thr√©e of the Latin Church, to te≈øtifie the truethe in this cau≈øe. Nowe therefore the la≈øte of all ≈øhal be <hi>Gela≈øius,</hi> whiche was a Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but one that was Bi≈øhop of that See before the wicked v≈øurpation and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny therof ≈øpred and bur≈øt out abroade into al the world.

            <p>
               <hi>Gela≈øius</hi> in an Epi≈øtle of the two natures of Chri≈øte, <hi>Contra Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichen,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gela≈øius.</note> writeth thus: <hi>The Sacraments of the body and blood of Chri≈øte, which we receiue, are godly things wherby and by the ≈øame wee are made partakers of the deuine nature, and yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance or nature of the bread and wine dooth not departe nor goe away.</hi>

               <p>Wellbeloved Friends and Brethren in our Saviour Chri≈øt, you mu≈øt under≈øtand that this Di≈øputation, with other that ≈øhall be after this, are appointed to ≈øearch for the plain truth of the Holy Scriptures in the≈øe matters of Religion, which of a long Sea≈øon have been hidden from us by the fal≈øe Glo≈ø≈øes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and now in our days mu≈øt be revealed to us Engli≈øhmen through the great Mercy of God principally; and ≈øecondarily, through the mo≈øt gentle Clemency of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sovereign Lord the Kings Maje≈øty, whom the living Lord long pre≈øerve to reign over us in Health, Wealth and Godline≈øs, to the maintenance of Gods holy Word, and to the extirpation of all blind Glo≈ø≈øes of Men, that go about to ≈øubvert the Truth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe therefore, that I am one that doth love the Truth, and have profe≈ø≈øed the ≈øame among≈øt you; therefore I ≈øay, becau≈øe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring my mind with yours, I will here gladly declare what I think in this point now in Controver≈øy. Not becau≈øe this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipful Doctor hath any need of my help in di≈ø≈øolving of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propo≈øed again≈øt him; for as me ≈øeemeth, he hath an≈øwered hitherto very well, and Clerkly, according to the Truth of Gods Word.

the outward ≈øign, but to the Body of Chri≈øt it ≈øelf in Heaven. For that Body is there only in a ≈øign virtually, by Grace, in the exhibition of it in Spirit, Effect and Faith, to the worthy receiver of it. For we receive virtually only Chri≈øts Body in the Sacrament.</p>

               <speaker>Glin.</speaker>
               <p>How then (if it plea≈øe your good Lord≈øhip) doth Bapti≈øm differ from this Sacrament? For in that we receive Chri≈øt al≈øo by Grace, and virtually.</p>

               <p>Chri≈øt is pre≈øent after another ≈øort in Bapti≈øm, than in this Sacrament; for in that he purgeth and wa≈øheth the Infant from all kind of Sin, but here he doth feed ≈øpiritually the receiver in Faith with all the merits of his ble≈ø≈øed Death and Pa≈ø≈øion; and yet he is in Heaven ≈øtill really and ≈øub≈øtantially. As for Example, The Kings Maje≈øty, our Lord and Ma≈øter, is but in one place, where≈øoever that this Royal Per≈øon is abiding for the time, and yet his mighty Power and Authority is every where in his Realms and Dominions: So Chri≈øts real Per≈øon is only in Heaven ≈øub≈øtantially placed, but his might is in all things created effectually. For Chri≈øts Fle≈øh may be under≈øtood for the Power, or inward Might of his Fle≈øh.</p>

               <p>If it plea≈øe your Fatherhood, St. <hi>Ambro≈øe,</hi> and St. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> do ≈øay, That before the Con≈øecration, it is but very Bread, and after the Con≈øecration, it is called the very Body of Chri≈øt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Madew.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed it is the very Body of Chri≈øt Sacramentally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Con≈øecration, whereas before it is nothing but common Bread; and yet, after that, it is the Lords Bread; and thus mu≈øt St. <hi>Ambro≈øe,</hi> and St. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> be under≈øtood.</p>

               <p>Fir≈øt, I deny (Ma≈øter Doctor) that <hi>Dama≈øcene</hi> was one thou≈øand years pa≈øt: Secondarily, I ≈øay, That he is not to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as an Ancient Father, for that he maintaineth in his Works, evil and damnable Doctrine, as the wor≈øhipping of Images and ≈øuch like. Thirdly, I ≈øay, That indeed God by his holy Spirit, is the worker of that which is done in the Sacrament. Al≈øo I grant, that there is a Mutation of the common Bread and Wine ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally into the Lords Bread and Wine, by the ≈øanctifying of them in the Lords Word. But I deny that there is any Mutation of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances; for there is no other change there indeed, than there is in us, which when we do receive the Sacrament worthily, then are we changed into Chri≈øts Body, Bones and Blood, not in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but ≈øpiritually, and by Grace; much like as <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> ≈øaw the burning Coal, even ≈øo we ≈øee not there the very ≈øimple Bread, as it was before the Con≈øecration; for an Union cannot be but of two very things. Wherefore, if we be joyned to Chri≈øt receiving the Sacrament, then there is no Adnihilation of Bread, which is when it is reduced to nothing, as it is in your feigned Tran≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>

the My≈øtery is the verity. For the Di≈øciples would not have been offended to have drunk a figure of Chri≈øt's Blood, being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øtomed to figures.

Becau≈øe therefore that Chri≈øt ≈øaid, <hi>This is my body;</hi> let us not at any hand doubt (≈øaith he) but let us believe it, and well perceive it with the eyes of our under≈øtanding. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little after in that place he ≈øaith thus, It was not enough that he was become man, and afterwards was ≈øcourged for us, but al≈øo he did reduce and bring us to be as one body with him, not through Faith only, but in very deed al≈øo he maketh us his Body. And after that he ≈øaith, that the≈øe works are not of mans power.

               <p>Honourable Sir, by your patience I grant that he gave to his Di≈øciples no ≈øen≈øible thing in ≈øub≈øtance, but a thing in≈øen≈øible, his own precious Body and Blood, under the only kinds of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And truly, as it ≈øeemeth, <hi>Theophylactus</hi> be≈øt knew the meaning of <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome,</hi> becau≈øe all Authors accept him as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Interpreter of him. And he hath the≈øe ≈øame plain words Tran≈øelemented and Transformed. Al≈øo <hi>Theophylactus Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ≈øuper Marcum, Cyrillus,</hi> and St. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaith, That before the con≈øecration it is bread, but afterwards it is Chri≈øts very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. In like manner St. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> upon the 33d <hi>P≈øalm</hi> ≈øaith, That
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46245:26"/>
in the la≈øt Supper Chri≈øt did bear him≈øelf in his own hands. Now every man may bear the figure of his body in his own hands, but St. <hi>Augu≈øtin</hi> ≈øaith it there for a Miracle. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his fifth Book is of the ≈øame mind. And St. <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> ≈øaith, I do remember my words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Law and Figures were by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> but the verity and Body came by Chri≈øt.</p>

changed in the Sub≈øtance or in the Accidents, or el≈øe in both, or in nothing? No man can ju≈øtly ≈øay, that there is a change into nothing. And all ancient Fathers do agree, that the ≈øame acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are there ≈øtill after, that were before; nor doth any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ≈øay, That there is any mutation both of the Sub≈øtance and Accidents al≈øo; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Sub≈øtance of Bread is changed into ≈øome other thing that is there really pre≈øent under the forms of Bread and Wine, which by Chri≈øts words mu≈øt needs be his own Ble≈ø≈øed Body.</p>

The principal Grounds, or rather Head-≈øprings of this matter are ≈øpecially five.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fir≈øt is the Authority, Maje≈øty and Verity of Holy Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third is the definition of a Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth is the abominable Here≈øie of</hi> Eutiches <hi>that may en≈øue of Tran≈øub≈øtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fifth is the mo≈øt ≈øure belief of the Article of our Faith,</hi> He a≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven.</p>
               <div n="1" type="ground">
                  <head>The Fir≈øt Ground.</head>
                  <p>This Tran≈øub≈øtantiation is clean again≈øt the words of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and con≈øent of the ancient Catholick Fathers. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ≈øaith, <hi>I will not drink hereafter of this fruit of the Vine,</hi> &amp;c. Now the fruit of this Vine is Wine. And it is manife≈øt that Chri≈øt ≈øpake the≈øe words after the Supper was fini≈øhed, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth both in <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and al≈øo in <hi>Luke,</hi> if they be well under≈øtood. There be not many places of Scripture that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this thing, neither is it greatly material: for it is enough if there be any one plain te≈øtimony for the ≈øame. Neither ought it to be mea≈øured by the number of Scriptures, but by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and by the verity of the ≈øame. And the Maje≈øty of this verity is as ample in one ≈øhort ≈øentence of the Scripture, as in a thou≈øand.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Chri≈øt took Bread, he gave Bread. In the <hi>Acts, Luke</hi> calleth it Bread. So <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it Bread after the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Both of them ≈øpeak of breaking, which belongeth to the Sub≈øtance of Bread, and in no wi≈øe to Chri≈øt's Body, for the Scripture ≈øaith, <hi>Ye ≈øhall not break a bone of him.</hi> Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>Do ye this in my remembrance.</hi> And again, <hi>As often as ye ≈øhall drink of this Cup, do it in rememberance of me.</hi> And our Saviour Chri≈øt in the ≈øixth of <hi>John,</hi> ≈øpeaking again≈øt the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Labour for the meat that peri≈øheth not.</hi> And when they asked, <hi>What ≈øhall we do that we may work the works of God?</hi> He an≈øwered them thus, <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he hath ≈øent.</hi> You ≈øee how he exhorteth them to faith, <hi>For Faith is that work of God.</hi> Again, <hi>This is that Bread which came down from Heaven.</hi> But Chri≈øts Body came not down from Heaven. Moreover, <hi>He that eateth my fle≈øh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. My fle≈øh</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</hi> When they

And whil'≈øt they were offended, he ≈øaid unto them, <hi>What if ye ≈øhall ≈øee the Son of Man a≈øcend up where he was before?</hi> Whereby he went about to draw them from the gro≈øs and carnal eating. <hi>This Body,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>≈øhall a≈øcend up into Heaven,</hi> meaning altogether, as St. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaith. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Fle≈øh profiteth nothing.

For his Body wherein he ro≈øe again mu≈øt needs be in one place, but his verity is ≈øpread abroad every where.</hi> Al≈øo in another place he ≈øaith, <hi>Let the godly al≈øo receive that Sacrament, but let them not be careful</hi> (≈øpeaking there of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of his Body.) <hi>For as touching his Maje≈øty, his Providence, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øible and un≈øpeakable Grace, the≈øe words are fulfilled which he ≈øpake,</hi> I am with you to the end of the World. <hi>But according to the fle≈øh which he took upon him, according to that which was born of the Virgin, was apprehended of the Jews, was fa≈øtned to a Tree, taken down again from the Cro≈øs, lapped in Linnen Cloths, was buried and ro≈øe again, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared after his Re≈øurrection, ≈øo ye ≈øhall not have me always with you; and why? becau≈øe, that as concerning his Fle≈øh, he was conver≈øant with his Di≈øciples forty days, and they accompanying him, ≈øeeing him, but not following him, he went up into Heaven, and is not here, for he ≈øitteth at the right hand of his Father; and yet he is here, becau≈øe he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted hence, as concerning the pre≈øence of his Divine Maje≈øty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark and con≈øider well what St. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>he is a≈øcended into Heaven, and is not here,</hi> ≈øaith he. <hi>Believe not them therefore which ≈øay that he is here ≈øtill in the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Doubt not</hi> (≈øaith the ≈øame <hi>Augu≈øtine, but that Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as concerning the nature of his Manhood, is there from whence he ≈øhall come. And remember well and believe the Profe≈ø≈øion of a Chri≈øtian man, that he aro≈øe from death, a≈øcended into Heaven, and ≈øitteth at the Right hand of his Father, and from that Place and none other</hi> (not from the Altars) <hi>≈øhall he come to judge the quick and the dead, and he ≈øhall come, as the Angel ≈øaid, as he was ≈øeen to go into Heaven; that is to ≈øay, in the ≈øame form and ≈øub≈øtance, unto the which he gave immortality, but changed not Nature. After this form (meaning his Humane Nature) we may not think that it is every-where.</hi> And in the ≈øame Epi≈øtle he ≈øaith, <hi>Take away from the Bodies limitation of places, and they ≈øhall be no-where; and becau≈øe they are no-where, they ≈øhall not be at all.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vigilius</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>If the Word and the Fle≈øh be both of one nature, ≈øeeing that the Word is every-where, why then is not the Fle≈øh al≈øo every-where? For when it was in Earth, then verily it was not in Heaven; and now when it is in Heaven, it is not ≈øurely in Earth. And it is ≈øo certain that it is</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:46245:29"/>
                     <hi>not in Earth, that as concerning the ≈øame, we look for him from Heaven; whom as concerning the Word, we believe to be with us in Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Al≈øo the ≈øame <hi>Vigilius</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Which things, ≈øeeing they be ≈øo, the cour≈øe of the Scripture mu≈øt be ≈øearched of us, and many Te≈øtimonies mu≈øt be gathered, to ≈øhew plainly what a wickedne≈øs and ≈øacriledg it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer tho≈øe things to the property of the Divine Nature, which do only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the nature of the Fle≈øh; and contrariwi≈øe, to apply tho≈øe things to the nature of the Fle≈øh, which do properly belong to the Divine Nature.</hi> Which thing the <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantiators</hi> do, whil≈øt they affirm Chri≈øt's Body not to be contained in any one place, and a≈øcribe that to his Humanity, which properly belongeth to his Divinity, as they do who will have Chri≈øt's Body to be in no one certain place limited.</p>
                  <p>Now in the latter Conclu≈øion concerning the Sacrifice, becau≈øe it dependeth upon the fir≈øt, I will in few words declare what I think. For if we did once agree in that, the whole Controver≈øie in the other would ≈øoon be at an end. Two things there be which do per≈øwade me that this Conclu≈øion is true; that is, certain places of the Scripture, and al≈øo certain Te≈øtimonies of the Fathers. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 9th, <hi>Chri≈øt being become an High Prie≈øt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this building, neither by the Blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own Blood, entred once into the Holy Place, and obtained for us eternal Redemption,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And now in the end of the World he hath appeared once to put away ≈øin by the ≈øacrifice of him≈øelf.</hi> And again, <hi>Chri≈øt was once offered to take away the ≈øins of many.</hi> Moreover he ≈øaith, <hi>With one offering hath he made perfect for ever tho≈øe that are ≈øanctified.</hi> The≈øe Scriptures do per≈øwade me to believe that there is no other oblation of Chri≈øt (albeit I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant there are many Sacrifices) but that which was once made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cro≈øs.</p>
                  <p>The Te≈øtimonies of the Ancient Fathers, which confirm the ≈øame, are out of <hi>Augu≈øtine ad Bonif. Epi≈øt.</hi> 23. Again, in his Book of 43 Que≈øtions, in the 41≈øt Que≈øtion. Al≈øo in his 20th Book again≈øt <hi>Fau≈øtus</hi> the <hi>Manichee,</hi> Chap. 21. And in the ≈øame Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the ≈øaid <hi>Fau≈øtus,</hi> Chap. 28. thus he writeth; <hi>Now the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians keep a memorial of the Sacrifice pa≈øt, with a holy Oblation and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Body and Blood of Chri≈øt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> in his Book <hi>De fide,</hi> calleth the ≈øame Oblation a Commemoration. And the≈øe things are ≈øufficient for this time for a Schola≈øtical Determination of the≈øe matters.</p>

                  <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> Ridley<hi>'s An≈øwer to the Three Propo≈øitions propo≈øed to him in the Di≈øputation at</hi> Oxford, April 12. 1554.</head>
               <p>I Received of you the other day, Right Wor≈øhipful Mr. <hi>Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,</hi> and ye my Reverend Ma≈øters, Commi≈ø≈øioners from the Queens Maje≈øty and her Honourable Council, Three Propo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whereunto ye commanded me to prepare again≈øt this day, what I thought good to an≈øwer concerning the ≈øame.</p>
               <p>Now whil≈øt I weighed with my ≈øelf, how great a charge of the Lord's Flock was of late committed unto me, for the which I mu≈øt once render an account to my Lord God, (and that how ≈øoon, he knoweth) and that moreover, by the Commandment of the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter,</hi> I ought to be ready alway to give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the Hope that is in me, with Meekne≈øs and Reverence unto every one that ≈øhall demand the ≈øame. Be≈øides this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidering my Duty to the Church of Chri≈øt, and to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips, being Commi≈ø≈øioners by Publick Authority, I determined with my ≈øelf to obey your Commandment, and ≈øo openly to declare unto you my mind touching the fore≈øaid Propo≈øitions; and albeit plainly to confe≈øs unto you the Truth in the≈øe things which ye now demand of me. I have thought otherwi≈øe in times pa≈øt, than now I do, yet (God I call to record unto my Soul, I lye not) I have not altered my Judgment, as now it is, either by con≈øtraint of any Man or Laws; either for the dread of any dangers of this World; either for any hope of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; but only for the love of the Truth revealed unto me by the Grace of God (as I am undoubtedly per≈øwaded) in his holy Word, and in the reading of the Ancient Fathers.</p>
               <p>The≈øe things I do rather recite at this pre≈øent, becau≈øe it may happen to ≈øome of you hereafter, as in times pa≈øt it hath done to me: I mean, if ye think otherwi≈øe of the matters propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the≈øe Propo≈øitions than I now do, God may open them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in time to come.</p>
               <p>But how≈øoever it ≈øhall be, I will in few words do that which I think ye all look I ≈øhould do; that is, as plainly as I can, I will declare my Judgment herein. Howbeit of this I would ye were not ignorant, that I will not indeed wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

≈øpeak in any Point again≈øt Gods Word, or di≈ø≈øent in any one jot from the ≈øame, or from the Rules of Faith, or Chri≈øtian Religion; which Rules that ≈øame mo≈øt Sacred word of God pre≈øcribeth to the Church of Chri≈øt, whereunto I now, and for ever ≈øubmit my ≈øelf and all my doings. And becau≈øe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have now taken in hand is weighty, and ye all well know how unready I am to handle it accordingly, as well for lack of time, as al≈øo lack of Books; therefore here I prote≈øt, that I will publickly this day require of you, that it may be lawful for me concerning all mine An≈øwers, Explications, and Confirmations, to add or dimini≈øh what≈øoever ≈øhall ≈øeem hereafter more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and meet for the purpo≈øe, through more ≈øound Judgment, better Deliberation, and more exact Trial of every particular Thing. Having now by the way of Preface and Prote≈øtation ≈øpoken the≈øe few words, I will come to the An≈øwer of the Propo≈øitions propounded unto me, and ≈øo to the mo≈øt brief Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Confirmation of mine An≈øwers.</p>

                  <p>In matters appertaining to God we may not ≈øpeak according to the ≈øen≈øe of Man, nor of the World.

               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>The Explication.</head>
                  <p>How far the diver≈øity and newne≈øs of the Phra≈øe in all this fir≈øt Propo≈øition, is from the Phra≈øe of the Holy Scripture, and that in every part almo≈øt, it is ≈øo plain and evident to any that is but meanly exerci≈øed in Holy Writ, that I need not now (e≈øpecially in this Company of Learned Men) to ≈øpend any time therein, except the ≈øame ≈øhall be required of me hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, There is a double ≈øen≈øe in the≈øe words <hi>(by virtue of God's Word)</hi> for it is doubtful what word of God this is; whether it be that which is read in the Evangeli≈øts, or in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other. And if it be that which is in the Evangeli≈øts, or in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> what that is. If it be in none of them, then how it may be known to be God's Word, and of ≈øuch virtue that it ≈øhould be able to work ≈øo great a matter.</p>
                  <p>Again, There is a doubt of the≈øe words <hi>(of the Prie≈øt)</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no man may be called a Prie≈øt, but he who hath Authority to make a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick and the dead; and how it may be proved that this Authority was committed of God to any man, but to Chri≈øt alone.</p>
                  <p>It is likewi≈øe doubted after what Order the Sacrificing Prie≈øt ≈øhall be, whether after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or el≈øe after the Order of <hi>Melchi≈øedech;</hi> for as far as I know, the Holy Scripture doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no more.</p>

For at the coming of this pre≈øence of the Body and Fle≈øh of Chri≈øt, they thru≈øt away the Sub≈øtance of Bread, and affirm that the Accidents remain without any Subject, and in≈øtead thereof they place Chri≈øt's Body without his qualities, and the true manner of a Body.

                     <p>But now (my Brethren) think not becau≈øe I di≈øallow that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence which the fir≈øt Propo≈øition maintaineth (as a Pre≈øence which I take to be forged, Phanta≈øtical, and be≈øides the Authority of God's Word, perniciou≈øly brought into the Church by the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øts)</hi> that I therefore go about to take away the true Pre≈øence of Chri≈øt's Body in his Supper rightly and duly admini≈øtred, which is grounded upon the Word of God, and made more plain by the Commentaries of the Faithful Fathers. They that think ≈øo of me, the Lord knoweth how far they are deceived; and to make the ≈øame evident unto you, I will in few words declare what true Pre≈øence of Chri≈øt's Body in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper I hold and affirm, with the Word of God and the Ancient Fathers.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øay and confe≈øs with the Evangeli≈øt <hi>Luke,</hi> and Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Bread on the which thanks are given, is the Body of Chri≈øt, in the remembrance of him and his Death, to be ≈øet forth perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually of the Faithful until his coming.</p>

                     <p>I ≈øay and believe that there is not only a ≈øignification of Chri≈øt's Body ≈øet forth by the Sacrament, but al≈øo that therewith is given to the Godly and Faithful the Grace of Chri≈øt's Body, that is, the food of Life and Immortality. And this I hold with <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ≈øay al≈øo with St. <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> that we eat Life, and we drink Life; with <hi>Emi≈øene,</hi> that we feel the Lord to be pre≈øent in Grace; with <hi>Athana≈øius,</hi> that we receive Cele≈øtial Food that cometh from above; the propriety of natural Communion, with <hi>Hilary;</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fle≈øh, and Benediction which giveth life in Bread and Wine, with <hi>Cyril;</hi> and with the ≈øame <hi>Cyril,</hi> the virtue of the very Fle≈øh of Chri≈øt, Life and Grace of his Body, the property of the only begotten, that is to ≈øay Life, as he him≈øelf in plain words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it.</p>
                     <p>I confe≈øs al≈øo with <hi>Ba≈øil,</hi> that we receive the my≈øtical Advent and coming of Chri≈øt, Grace and Virtue of his very Nature; the Sacrament of his very Fle≈øh, with <hi>Ambro≈øe;</hi> the Body by Grace, with <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> Spiritual Fle≈øh, but not that which was

                  <head>The Sixth Argument.</head>
                  <p>The Circum≈øtances of the Scripture, the Analogy and proportion of <note place="margin">Da-</note> the Sacraments, and the Te≈øtimony of the faithful Fathers, ought to rule us in taking the meaning of the Holy Scripture touching the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>But the Words of the Lord's Supper, the Circum≈øtances of the <note place="margin">ti-</note> Scripture, the Analogy of the Sacraments, and the Sayings of the Fathers, do mo≈øt effectually and plainly prove a figurative ≈øpeech in the words of the Lord's Supper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> A figurative ≈øen≈øe and meaning is ≈øpecially to be received in <note place="margin">≈øi.</note> the≈øe words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Circum≈øtances of the Scripture, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me. As oft as ye ≈øhall eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, ye ≈øhall ≈øhew forth the Lord's death. Let a man prove him≈øelf, and ≈øo eat of this bread, and drink of this cup. They came together to break Bread: and they continued in breaking of Bread. The Bread which we break,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For we being many, are all one Bread and one Body,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Analogy of the Sacraments is nece≈ø≈øary; for if the Sacraments had not ≈øome ≈øimilitude, or likene≈øs of the things whereof they be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, they could in no wi≈øe be Sacraments. And this ≈øimilitude in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is taken three manner of ways.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The fir≈øt con≈øi≈øteth in nouri≈øhing, as you ≈øhall read in <hi>Rabanus, Cyprian, Au≈øtin, Irenaeus,</hi> and mo≈øt plainly in <hi>I≈øidore</hi> out of <hi>Bertram.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The ≈øecond in the uniting and joyning of many into one, as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> teacheth.</item>
                     <item>3. The third is a ≈øimilitude of unlike things: Where, like as the Bread is turned into one Body; ≈øo we by the right u≈øe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are turned through Faith into the Body of Chri≈øt.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The ≈øayings of the Fathers declare it to be a figurative ≈øpeech, as it appeareth in <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Chry≈øo≈øtom in opere imperfecto, Augu≈øtin, Ambro≈øe, Ba≈øil, Gregory Nazianzen, Hilary,</hi> and mo≈øt plainly of all, in <hi>Bertram.</hi> Moreover the ≈øayings and places of all the Fathers, who≈øe names I have before recited again≈øt the a≈ø≈øertion of the fir≈øt Propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do quite overthrow Tran≈øub≈øtantiation.

               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>The Explication.</head>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Ma≈øs which is u≈øed at this day, or the lively Sacrifice thereof propitiatory and available for the ≈øins of the quick and the dead, the Holy Scripture hath not ≈øo much as one ≈øyllable.</p>
                  <p>There is ambiguity al≈øo in the name of Ma≈øs: what it ≈øignifieth, and whether at this day there be any ≈øuch indeed as the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers u≈øed; ≈øeeing that now there be neither <hi>Catecumeni</hi> nor <hi>Poenitentes</hi> to be ≈øent away.</p>
                  <p>Again, touching the≈øe words <hi>(The lively Sacrifice of the Church)</hi> There is doubt whether they are to be under≈øtood Figuratively and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, for the Sacrament of the lively Sacrifice (after which ≈øort we deny it not to be in the Lord's Supper) or properly and without any figure; of the which manner there was but one only Sacrifice, and that once offered, namely upon the Altar of the Cro≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in the≈øe words <hi>(as well as)</hi> it may be doubted whether they be ≈øpoken in mockage as men are wont to ≈øay in ≈øport, of a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh and ignorant per≈øon, that he is apt <hi>as well</hi> in conditions <hi>as</hi> in knowledg, being apt indeed in neither of them both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:46245:35"/>
There is al≈øo a doubt in the word <hi>Propitiable,</hi> whether it ≈øignify here that which taketh away ≈øin, or that which may be made available for the taking away of ≈øin; That is to ≈øay, whether it is to be taken in the active or in the pa≈ø≈øive ≈øignification.</p>
                  <p>Now the fal≈øne≈øs of the Propo≈øition, after the meaning of the Schoolmen and the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Church, and Impiety in that ≈øen≈øe which the words ≈øeem to import, is this; that they leaning to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their fond Tran≈øub≈øtantiation, would make the quick and lively body of Chri≈øt's Fle≈øh (united and knit to the Divinity) to lye hid under the accidents, and outward ≈øhews of Bread and Wine. Which is very fal≈øe, as I have ≈øaid before; and they building upon this foundation, do hold that the ≈øame Body is offered unto God, by the Prie≈øt in his dayly Ma≈ø≈øings, to put away the ≈øins of the quick and the dead; whereas by the Apo≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> it is evident that there is but one Oblation, and one true and lively Sacrifice of the Church offered upon the Altar of the Cro≈øs, which was, is, and ≈øhall be for ever the propitiation for the ≈øins of the whole World: and where there is Remi≈ø≈øion of the ≈øame, there is, ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, no more offering for ≈øin.</p>

                  <p>No Sacrifice ought to be done, but where the Prie≈øt is meet to offer <note place="margin">Ce-</note> the ≈øame.</p>

                  <p>That no man is called to this degree of Honour but Chri≈øt alone, it is evident; For there are but two only Orders of Prie≈øthood allowed in the Word of God: Namely, the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi≈øedech.</hi> But now the Order of <hi>Aaron</hi> is come to an end, by rea≈øon that it was unprofitable, and weak; and of the Order of <hi>Melchi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> there is but one Prie≈øt alone, even Chri≈øt the Lord, who hath a Prie≈øthood that cannot pa≈øs to any other.</p>

                  <p>I know that all the≈øe places of the Scripture are avoided by two manner of ≈øubtil ≈øhifts: The one is, by the di≈øtinction of the bloody and unbloody Sacrifice; as tho our unbloody Sacrifice of the Church were any other than the Sacrifice of Prai≈øe and Thank≈øgiving, than a commemoration, a ≈øhewing forth, and a Sacramental Repre≈øentation of that one only bloody Sacrifice, offered up once for all.</p>
                  <p>The other is by depraving and wre≈øting the Sayings of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers unto ≈øuch a ≈øtrange kind of ≈øen≈øe, as the Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves indeed never meant.

               <hi>I</hi> Will ≈øo divide the que≈øtion, that it may be briefly reduced to three heads. Fir≈øt, I will ≈øhew that the true Body of Chri≈øt is given to the Faithful in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and that the words <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Sub≈øtance,</hi> are not to be rejected, but that the Ancients treating of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did u≈øe them. In the next place, I will ≈øhew that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the proper Body of Chri≈øt, and that which is pre≈øent in the Sacrament, and that the Ancient Fathers thought ≈øo. La≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will ≈øhew, what manner of Body this is, which is received in this My≈øtery,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46245:39"/>
and why it is called by that Name, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the ≈øante Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The Body of Chri≈øt is ≈øo called proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and improperly; properly, that Body which was taken of the Virgin. Improperly, as the Sacrament and the Church. That the Church is not properly the Body of Chri≈øt, cannot be doubted by any. It remains, that we now prove the ≈øame of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It may ea≈øily be ob≈øerved from what <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> writeth in this place, that that which Chri≈øt called his Body when he ≈øaid, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body;</hi> and which be received together with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, is in another manner his Body, than is his very proper Body, which was fed with that other. This did eat, that was eaten, and each is called his Body, but in a different manner.</p>
            <p>He gave the Sacrament of his Body, and not the Body it ≈øelf vi≈øibly conceived, that is, his vi≈øible Body; which is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his proper Body. But this Body, wherever it is, is vi≈øible.</p>
            <p>It is to be ob≈øerved, That the truth of the Lords Body may be ≈øpoken two ways, and ought to be under≈øtood two ways. For one verity of his Body is required in the Sacrament, another ≈øimply and out of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns our purpo≈øe, the very words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> ≈øufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate, how the Letter is not to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in tho≈øe things, which relate to this My≈øtery; how far all carnal Sen≈øe is to be removed, and all things to be referred to a ≈øpiritual Sen≈øe; that with this Bread is pre≈øent, the Divine Virtue, the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46245:39"/>
effect of Eternal Life; that the Divine E≈ø≈øence is infu≈øed; that the Words are Spirit and Life; that a ≈øpiritual Precept is delivered; that this Body, this Fle≈øh and Blood, this Sub≈øtance of the Body ought not to be under≈øtood after a common manner, nor according to the Dictates of human Rea≈øon; but is ≈øo named, thought and believed, becau≈øe of certain eminent Effects, Virtues and Properties, which are joyned to it, which are naturally found in the Body and Blood of Chri≈øt, to wit, that it feed and quicken our Souls, and prepare our Bodies to Re≈øurrection and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Here it is to be remembred, that the words are ≈øpiritual, and ≈øpiritually to be under≈øtood; that it is indeed named Fle≈øh and Blood, but that this ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood of the Spirit and Life, that is, of the lively Virtue of the Fle≈øh of our Lord, ≈øo that the Efficacy of Life is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on the external Signs.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Theophylact</hi> ≈øaid, That the Bread is not the Figure of our Lords Body, he means that it is not only (or a bare) Figure of it.</p>
            <p>See how <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> ≈øaith, That we are really, as I may ≈øo ≈øay, turned into the Fle≈øh of Chri≈øt. Yet who doth not ≈øee that this is a ≈øpiritual, not a carnal Conver≈øion: So the Bread is really turned and tran≈øelementated into the Fle≈øh of Chri≈øt, but by a ≈øpiritual, not a carnal Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, ina≈ømuch as as the Bread obtains the Virtue of the Fle≈øh.</p>
            <p>How much better did <hi>Cyprian, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro≈øe, Epiphanius, Emy≈øenus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ≈øpeak, who teach a like change to be performed in the Euchari≈øt, as is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Bapti≈øm, by which the external
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46245:40"/>
Signs remain the ≈øame, and by Grace acquire a new ≈øub≈øtance in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The Expo≈øition and Doctrine of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> concerning the Sacrament, ought in my Opinion to be diligently examined and embraced for two Rea≈øons.</p>
            <p>That this may appear more manife≈øtly, and be remembred the better, I thought it not unfit to ≈øubjoyn from what I have already taught, a certain Compari≈øon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Bodies of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>The proper Body of Chri≈øt hath Head, Brea≈øt, and di≈øtinct Members; the my≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body hath not. The proper Body hath Bones, Veins and Nerves; the my≈øtical Body hath not.</p>
            <p>That is organical; this is not.</p>
            <p>That is not a Figure; this is a Figure of the proper Body. That is human and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal by its Nature; this is Heavenly, Divine, and Spiritual.</p>
            <p>The matter of that is not ≈øubject to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; the material part of this is Bread, and is corrupted.</p>
            <p>That is contained in one place; this is pre≈øent, where≈øoever the Sacrament is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, but not, as in a place.</p>
            <p>That is not the Sacrament of another Body; this the Sacrament of another.</p>
            <p>That was taken of the Body of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was once created; this is not taken of the Virgin, but is created daily by the my≈øtical Benediction potentially.</p>
            <p>That is a natural Body, this ≈øupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. La≈øtly, That is ≈øimply, properly and ab≈øolutely his Body; this in a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect only and improperly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:46245:40"/>
Nor is it enough here, if we flee one way of carnally under≈øtanding it, and fall upon another. For he who literally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtands the eating of the Fle≈øh of Chri≈øt, and as altho it were a proper Speech, he is a carnal Capernaite; whether he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be properly done this way, or that way. For it is probable that all the Capernaites under≈øtood Chri≈øt carnally, but not all the ≈øame way.</p>
            <p>For it is not therefore to be accounted a Spiritual ≈øen≈øe, becau≈øe they ≈øay the Fle≈øh of Chri≈øt is there invi≈øibly pre≈øent. For if they mean his proper Fle≈øh, we do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not eat it carnally, becau≈øe we do not ≈øee it.</p>
            <p>Now in this Sacrament the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ob≈øerved two things, for each of which it might de≈øervedly be called and e≈øteemed the Body of Chri≈øt; but more e≈øpecially when it comprehends both. For the Bread is ju≈øtly called his Body, as well becau≈øe it is the figure of his true Body, as becau≈øe it hath the lively vertue of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to it, much more; but mo≈øt e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, becau≈øe it comprehendeth both.</p>
            <p>It is therefore to be admired, what they mean, who will not ≈øuffer it to be called a figure, nor acknowledg any figure in the words of In≈øtitution, but contumeliou≈øly call tho≈øe who own it, Figurative men, whereas it is manife≈øt that all the Ancients did ≈øo call it. And indeed if there be no figure in it, it will be neither a ≈øign nor Sacrament. So that tho≈øe who traduce the maintainers of the other opinion as Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, do indeed take away all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it.</p>
            <p>There is yet another thing, which the Ancient Fathers acknowledging to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46245:41"/>
be in this Sacrament, taught it to be truly the Body of our Lord; And that is the efficacious and lively vertue of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it ≈øelf, which is joyned with the Bread and Wine by Grace and My≈øtical Benediction, and is called by divers names, although it be the ≈øame thing: by <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtine,</hi> the Intelligible, Invi≈øible and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body: by <hi>Jerome</hi> the Divine and Spiritual Fle≈øh: by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thing: by <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> the Spiritual Food and Body of the Divine Spirit: by others ≈øome other like thing. And this doth chiefly cau≈øe this Sacrament to be worthy of the appellation of his true Body and Blood, ≈øince it doth not only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bear the Image and Figure of it, but al≈øo carrieth along with it the inward and hidden natural propriety of the ≈øame Body; ≈øo that it cannot be e≈øteemed an empty Figure, or the ≈øign of a thing whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ab≈øent, but the very Body of our Lord: Divine indeed and Spiritual, but pre≈øent by Grace, full of vertue, powerful in effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. For this is very frequent, that the names of things them≈øelves be a≈øcribed to their virtue and efficacy.</p>
            <p>The Fathers therefore in Treating of the Sacraments, u≈øe the words <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Sub≈øtance</hi> not Philo≈øophically but Theologically: that is, they ≈øpeak not as natural Philo≈øophers, but as men di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Divine matters; they give the name of Nature and Sub≈øtance to Grace, Virtue and Efficacy: the nature of the Sacrament ≈øo requiring.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>(that the Spiritual virtue is in≈øeparable from the Elements)</hi> is to be under≈øtood to be true, as long as the Sign ≈øerveth for that u≈øe, and is directed to that end, for which it was de≈øtined by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46245:41"/>
the Word of God. For if we apply it to other u≈øes, and abu≈øe it again≈øt the in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chri≈øt, it either is altogether not a Sacrament, or cea≈øeth to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The dignity and due honour of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is not injured, but remaineth whole and inviolate, while we confe≈øs both the truth of the Body, and the nature and ≈øub≈øtance of it, to be received by the Faithful, together with the Symbols: which al≈øo the ancient Fathers te≈øtifie to be done. And then this di≈øtinction which al≈øo tho≈øe Fathers diligently ob≈øerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received between that proper or a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Body of the Lord, and this Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body, or Sacrament of the Body, the analogy of our Faith is not violated, which no ways ought to be ≈øhaken: ≈øince we attribute to each Body his peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. For we ≈øay that the proper and a≈ø≈øumed Body is in a place, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed with a ≈øpace, by rea≈øon of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> of a true Body, as <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All men ≈øee, that we al≈øo here affirm the Sub≈øtance to be pre≈øent, and a≈ø≈øert our Communion with Chri≈øt naturally, and as I may ≈øay, ≈øub≈øtantially. But then the≈øe words ought to be under≈øtood after the manner not of Philo≈øophers but of Divines. Neither ≈øhould we quarrel about the term of <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantiation,</hi> although barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and not in the lea≈øt nece≈ø≈øary: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they meant thereby ≈øuch a Tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Sub≈øtances, as the Ancients taught: that is, a Sacramental one: ≈øuch as is al≈øo performed in a man regenerated by Bapti≈øm, who is made a new man, and a new creature. Such as is al≈øo performed when we are converted into the Fle≈øh of
